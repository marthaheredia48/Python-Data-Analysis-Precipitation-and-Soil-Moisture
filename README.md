## Python Data Analysis: Precipitation and Soil Moisture

For our project in the NASA Space Apps Hackathon, we aimed to implement data analysis on **precipitation** and **soil moisture** using **Xcode Swift**. However, due to time constraints and challenges in integrating the data processing in Swift, we decided to conduct the analysis using **Python** and include the results directly in our final project.

### Soil Moisture Data (April 2024)
The code provided in this repository processes **soil moisture data** for the geographic coordinates **(19.056097, -98.305089)** for **April 2024**. We analyzed this data to assess how soil moisture levels respond to local climate conditions, providing insights into irrigation requirements for agriculture.

### Precipitation Data (May 2023 - April 2024)
Although the code here focuses on soil moisture, we followed the **same procedure** for analyzing the **precipitation data** from **May 2023 to April 2024** for the same geographic location. By simply swapping the data files, we were able to evaluate seasonal rainfall patterns and their relationship to soil moisture and crop health.

Although we couldn't implement the data analysis in **Swift**, using **Python** allowed us to efficiently process and visualize the data. These results were included in our final project to demonstrate how changes in precipitation and soil moisture impact local agricultural practices.
